**SIMPLE CALCULATOR**

Create a Python program that acts as a basic calculator. It should prompt the user to enter two numbers and choose an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Then, it should perform the selected operation and display the result to the user.

Hereâ€™s a Python program that functions as a **simple calculator**:

**How It Works:**
1. The user enters **two numbers**.
2. The program displays four operation options: **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.
3. The user **selects an operation** by entering its number or symbol.
4. The program performs the chosen operation and displays the **result**.

**Key Features:**
1. Handles invalid input gracefully with error messages.
2. Checks for division by zero to prevent runtime errors.
3. Supports flexible input for operation choice (number or symbol).
